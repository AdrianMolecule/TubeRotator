Instructions:

 

Download and install the TMCStepper Arduino library, linked here: https://github.com/teemuatlut/TMCStepper
Print all the included parts and/or modify the parts in TinkerCAD as linked above.
Print 8 matching tube adaptors or design your own to fit that magnetic slot dimension. If you are going to print my tube holder design, print just one holder first and do a test fit, if your specific tube is smaller or larger, try editing the tube holder file in TinkerCAD or your CAD editor of choice. If you're using TinkerCAD, you can use the “ungroup” function to gain dimensional access to just the cylindrical portion of the tube holder and modify that dimension specifically.
Install 12x6x3mm magnets in the rotor, keeping identical polarities facing upward across all 8 magnet slots. Use black silicone sealant to adhere the magnets if friction fit is not enough.
Install similar magnets to each of the tube adapters, check the polarity such that each tube adaptor is attracted to the rotor slot magnets. Only test magnetic pull once rotor magnet sealant is cured to avoid ripping magnets out of their slots. Ensure the tube adapter magnets are flush with the flat rectangular surface. Connect all tube adaptors to the rotor to check polarities and ensure all tube adapters mate in the same direction.
Strip 4mm off each of the wires attached to the stepper motor.
Crimp on male DuPont connector to each wire and slide on black plastic DuPont connector sheath.
Solder female pin header rows to the Stealth Chop Dev Board.
Slide the stepper motor wires through the printed stepper housing.
Connect the stepper wires to the Dev Board as follows: A1: Black, A2: Green, B1: Red, B2: Blue
Connect the Vio pin to Arduino 3v
Connect the Vmot pin to Arduino 5v
Connect the DIR, STEP and ENABLE pins on the Stealth Chop Dev Board to Arduino pins 4, 5, and 6 respectively.
Connect GNDmot and GNDio grounds to Arduino GND pins.
Connect the motor shaft to the 5mm rod via the shaft coupler. Ensure the shafts meet in the middle of the coupler and tighten.
Slot the 5mm bearing into the printed bearing housing.
Slot the bottom 5mm rods to the housing feet and push everything together, aligning the 5mm motor rod into the 5mm bearing bore.
Upload the included code to the Arduino, the motor should begin rotating. If it makes a stall noise just give the motor rod a manual twist in the direction of rotation to overcome initial friction. Take note of any wobble or eccentricities. If there is wobble, cut power to the Arduino and adjust the shaft coupling since that is the central source of wobble. There will always be a bit of wobble due to shaft manufacturing defects.
Attach the two flange couplers to the rotor and fasten with M3x30mm screws. Be mindful of the tiny worm screws in the flange as they may get lost.
Disassemble the bearing housing from the 5mm rods and slide the rotor onto the 5mm motor shaft, center it, reattach the bearing housing to all the rods. Once rotor is centered, screw in the worm screws to secure the rotor to the motor shaft.
Ensure everything is pushed together firmly. Apply rubber feet to the bottom of each printed housing. Turn on the Arduino and see if it spins. Remember if it stalls just give it a twist to help it start.


MINE:
Sebi 50 ml tubes 115x30 cm
mine https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006347439712.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.81.344e1802VMgNMz
103x27 so a tad smaller but still 50 ml

so min wall to wall 106 + 1 cm on each side->12.5 cm
my magnets 4.6 cubes
angle is 45

lemonade width 16.5 cm
